### 1. Assignment on Linear Regression:
-The following table shows the results of a recently conducted study on the correlation of the
number of hours spent driving with the risk of developing acute backache. Find the equation of
the best fit line for this data.

### 2. Assignment on Decision Tree Classifier:
A dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing details of customers and whether or not they
responded to a special offer to buy a new lip-stick is shown in table below. Use this dataset to
build a decision tree, with Buys as the target variable, to help in buying lip-sticks in the future.
Find the root node of decision tree. According to the decision tree you have made from
previous training data set, what is the decision for the test data: [Age < 21, Income = Low,
Gender = Female, Marital Status = Married]?

### 3. Assignment on k-NN Classification:
In the following diagram let blue circles indicate positive examples and orange squares indicate
negative examples. We want to use k-NN algorithm for classifying the points. If k=3, find the
class of the point (6,6). Extend the same example for Distance-Weighted k-NN and Locally
weighted Averaging

### 4. Assignment on K-Means Clustering:
We have given a collection of 8 points. P1=[0.1,0.6] P2=[0.15,0.71] P3=[0.08,0.9] P4=[0.16,
0.85] P5=[0.2,0.3] P6=[0.25,0.5] P7=[0.24,0.1] P8=[0.3,0.2]. Perform the k-mean clustering
with initial centroids as m1=P1 =Cluster#1=C1 and m2=P8=cluster#2=C2. Answer the
following
1] Which cluster does P6 belongs to?
2] What is the population of cluster around m2?
3] What is updated value of m1 and m2?

### Mini-Project 1 on Genetic Algorithm:
Apply the Genetic Algorithm for optimization on a dataset obtained from UCI ML repository.
For Example: IRIS Dataset or Travelling Salesman Problem or KDD Dataset

### Mini-Project 2 on SVM:
Apply the Support vector machine for classification on a dataset obtained from UCI ML
repository.
For Example: Fruits Classification or Soil Classification or Leaf Disease Classification


### Mini-Project 3 on PCA:
Apply the Principal Component Analysis for feature reduction on any Company Stock Market
Dataset
